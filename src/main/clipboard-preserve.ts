 * writes back - a naive per-caller save/restore would let an overlapping flow
 * snapshot the *other* flow's scratch value and then restore it last, leaving
 * that scratch value on the clipboard for good. That is exactly what a
 * price-check landing inside a `/itemfilter` chat paste did: the clipboard was
 * left holding the chat command (#562).
