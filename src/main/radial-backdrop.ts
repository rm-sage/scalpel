/** Longest side of the encoded backdrop.
 *
 *  This used to be 192, on the reasoning that the (then 18px) blur throws away
 *  anything finer. The reasoning was backwards: the renderer stretches this image
 *  back up to the crop's full ~460 CSS px, so the blur is measured in DISPLAY px,
 *  and at 192 that worked out to a Gaussian spanning a fifth of the source image.
 *  It was not softening the scene, it was averaging it - the crop arrived as one
 *  flat colour before the grade even started, which is also why the shipped blur
 *  is now 2px rather than 18.
 *
 *  So the target is the disc's own physical pixels. The visible disc is at most
 *  2 * (RING_RADIUS * RADIAL_SCALE_MAX + ICON_HALO + DISC_PAD) = 237 CSS px of
 *  the 460 CSS px crop; asking for that region at the display's physical
 *  resolution is the same as asking for the whole crop at it, which is exactly
 *  what `cropped` already is (frame.scale carries the display scale factor).
 *  This constant therefore only has to be a ceiling, and since the crop shrank
 *  with the ring it is now a roomy one: 640 keeps everything up to a 1.39x
 *  display untouched and still gives a 1.5x one ~0.93 of native. The encoded
 *  frame is correspondingly cheaper than the measurement below, which was taken
 *  at the full 640.
 *
 *  Paired with JPEG below, because 640^2 of PNG'd game art is most of a megabyte
 *  and this rides the hotkey path. */

/** JPEG quality for the encode. High enough that Raw view in the developer
 *  tuning panel shows a clean crop - the whole point of that view is to judge
 *  the CAPTURE, so it must not end up judging the codec - and low enough to keep
 *  the data URL modest. Measured on a deliberately grain-heavy 640px stand-in
 *  (worse than real game art): ~118KB here, against ~1.1MB for the same frame as
 *  PNG, which is why this path cannot stay on nativeImage's default encoder.
 *  The shipped look blurs the result at 18px, where the codec is invisible. */

/** One-shot grab of the game pixels behind the radial menu: capture a frame,
 *  cut a square of `half` CSS px either side of the open point, and encode it at
 *  up to ENCODE_MAX_PX. Returns where the crop actually landed in game CSS px,
 *  which is how
 *  the renderer puts it back down 1:1 without replicating any of this math -
 *  the crop clamps at the frame edges, so what comes back is often neither
 *  centred on `center` nor `2 * half` wide.
 *
 *  Never throws: on any failure it reports which gate closed and the caller
 *  keeps its plain tinted disc. The disc alone is a perfectly good menu, and
 *  this runs on the hotkey path.
 *
 *  skipFocusGate is the whole reason the backdrop works at all. This is called
 *  microseconds after the radial overlay's own show(), and
 *  OverlayController.targetHasFocus flickers around exactly that - the same trap
 *  getGameCursorPosition documents and sidesteps. Re-asking the flag here made
 *  the grab return null more often than not, with nothing in the payload to say
 *  why. The privacy invariant holds without it: this can only be reached from
 *  inside a radial open, which only happens on a hotkey the app-macro dispatch
 *  already gated on the game being the active context. */
